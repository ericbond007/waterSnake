The Official Twitter Bot for Lake Monroe Water Levels

Check out the [Twitter account here](https://twitter.com/LakeMonroeWater)

This twittter bot pulls data from the US Water Services REST API, compares the current water level to the nominal pool level, then tweets out any change in water level from the previous reading. Fun fact: this bot runs once an hour during human waking hours.
